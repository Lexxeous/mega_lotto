MegaLotto is a Ruby gem built via the free "Build a Ruby Gem" email tutorial course provided by [Brandon Hilkert](https://brandonhilkert.com/). This repository was created simply as my interpretation of the project. I claim no affiliation or ownership of any following code or concepts.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "mega_lotto"
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself with:
```sh
$ gem install mega_lotto
```

## Usage

Main Ruby code is located in the `lib/mega_lotto` file. Supporting files are located in neighboring files within the `lib/` directory. To experiment with this code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Run `rake spec`, `rspec spec`, or simply `rspec` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
